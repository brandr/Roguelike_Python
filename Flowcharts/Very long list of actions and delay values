Very long list of actions and delay values (IN PROGRESS) 
	1) This is going to be pretty rough, but I'm basically going to classify stuff as either being VAR (variable), 0 (instant or near-instantaneous), 1 (short 0-6 second action), 2 (medium 6-12 second action), or 3 (long 12-24 second action). Actions that are ongoing, such as getting damaged by poison, healing a wound, or learning a spell remain uncategorized.

	2) This is also first and foremost a list of possible game actions, because it sort of betrays my terrible grip on how the queue delay system works even though its been explained to me about 3 times. I'll try to go exhaustive rather than accurate.

	3) I'll try and order these into categories and do my best to tab-seperate my fields, so that if we have to we can easily paste it into an empty .txt file and write a script to sort it any which way.
