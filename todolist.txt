CURRENT MAIN GOALS:

ROBERT:

* Keep working out combat system, though don't need to worry about death until later.
	-let nick play the current version and figure out what he wants for the fundamentals.
	-mention important cases like player and monster attempting to move into a space at the same time,
		player moving out of the way before a monster attacks, etc.
* Let the player pick up items 
	-(remember that doing so takes time, and the player should not autopickup when monsters are near)

NICK:

* Come up with a rough and tentative but very long and diverse list of actions and delay values.
	-In other words, the list should cover many possible actions, but the delay values will be
		very easy to change, so don't worry about making them exact.


Things to do in order of precedence: (try to add things to the stage where they seem to fit in best)

STAGE 1 
        Basic structure of combat (Robert) (possibly done with this for now)
        
STAGE 2
		Basic item systems (start with Weapons and Equipment. Monsters should be able to hold and drop items from the start.)
		Ability to open other screens (try inventory screen)
		Implement wielding basics (remember that anything can be wielded, not just proper weapons)
		More controls, like waiting by pressing, equipping, etc. Will have to flesh out control system a lot.
		Basic control contexts (trying to equip over already-equipped item, etc.)

STAGE 3
		Systems for attack speed, hp, death, etc. (player death might just close the screen for now, or notify and prompt revive.)
		General equipment system (plan ahead. Focus on armor and shields, but allow for amulets/rings/etc)
		Dodging/blocking/armor mechanics
		More advanced combat (how do weapons/equipment change combat? What values should we abstract until later?)
		Make event pane scrollable
		Item identification

STAGE 4
		Status effects (make sure they work with current turn system) (could make temporary potions)
		Advanced control contexts (will have to flesh out control system a lot)
		Some basic hazards (like lava) to help figure out player movement and control contexts

STAGE 5
		Throwing, Ammo and ranged weapons (this will change the combat system somewhat)
		Graphics system (like arrow moving across screen)

STAGE 6
		Typed damage like fire, ice, poison (may want to implement sooner)
		Player attributes (STR, DEX, etc.) (this will change combat system a little.)
		HP and MP regeneration
		Consider factors which might alter player move/attack speed, like burdening (need to implement item weight for this)
		Item enchantments
		Item brands
		Basic spell system (only need to make like 1 spell)
		Expand graphics to accomodate spell; try to plan ahead and be extensible

STAGE 7
		Traps
		"Searchable" tiles (hidden doors, traps, etc.)
		Signs that the player can read

STAGE 8
		Stairs, multiple levels, have to create a dungeon class (might create the dungeon class before this)
		Consider more tile types, like doors
		Make it easier to create monsters for testing (maybe focus on an editor context)
		Map editor (may benefit from some gui library)
... 

STAGE M - 2
		Beatitude
		Food and hunger (expand upon monster corpses)
		Wands
		Gold
		Branches
		Fully implement potions (can still add more potions, but the general system should be set up)
		Same for scrolls

STAGE M - 1
		Non-hostile monsters (will have to expand monster AI just slightly)
		Shopping?
		Pets?

STAGE M
		Spellbooks (expand magic system a bit)
		Player experience and leveling
		Special abilities
		Basic skill system (don't develop full tree yet, but figure out what a skill is and how it will be stored/processed)
		Player races/classes
		Monster classification (AI type, specices, etc.)
		Artifact items
		Unique monsters (how to store/create them? How might their values vary?)
...

STAGE N - 2
		Any remaining item types
		Level generation
		Item generation
		Monster generation
		Fully flesh out magic systems (how magic damage works, etc.)
        Final version of character creation (player stats can simply be hardcoded up to this point)
        Tertiary environmental attributes, like steam, wells, 

STAGE N - 1
		Sounds and monster awareness
		Complete Player and Monster FOV
        Fully flesh out monster AI (based on all facets of the game that will be available for monsters to interact with)
     	Highly independent systems, like gods, skill trees, some unique artifact systems, etc.
     	Ability to save the game to a file, and load a game from that file.

STAGE N 
		Final context of game launch. This includes the title screen, level editor, etc.
        Actual game: dungeon layout, unique levels/mosters/artifacts, setting up the values for gods/skills/monster spawing/level generation/item generation, etc.
	    Final tweaks and adjustments-- now entering the pure game design phase (changing values for balance, significant playtesting, etc.)
