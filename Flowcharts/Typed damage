Typed damage, resistances, saves, and status effects:

1) Damage is a quality that reduces hitpoints. If damage can be avoided by any means once inflicted, it is /typed/. 
2) Resistances prevent elemental (fire, ice, poison) types of damage from being inflicted, as well as lessening it when it is successfully done to you.  
3) 
4) Typed damage is reduced once inflicted (by some math I haven't thought of yet) by the corresponding resistance.
5)
